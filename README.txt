SPRITEMAKER creates a big image with the content of many other images.

How to use:
- Put your .png files inside the "input" directory.
- Call "java -jar SpriteMaker 10", where 10 can be any number (greater or equal to 1) to represent the max number of columns. Warning: the application may throw an exception if the final image has too many rows or columns.
- An image called "output.png" will be generated in the current directory.
